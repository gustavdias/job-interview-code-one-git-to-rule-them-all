// Classes: they donâ€™t add anything new to the language 
// They just make implementation of prototype inheritance and to create objects based on blueprints (ES5 constructors)

//If you want to add a method you just include the function inside the class block.

//------------------

// Static methods are methods that are simply attached to the class, but not inherited by the class instances(by objects that we create through that class).

static greeting() {
    console.log('Hey there!');
}


// Is basically a method that is attached to this class definition
// the class definition under the hood is a function definition(so is also a object)
//so in the end is just a function attached to a object
//the classes definitions are not hoisted, so unlike in function constructors we need to first implement a class and only later to use it.
//can only methods to classes, but not properties, because inheriting properties through the object instances is not the best practice
